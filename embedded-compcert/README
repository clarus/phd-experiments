                The CompCert C verified compiler

OVERVIEW:

The CompCert C verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset of the
C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC, ARM and x86
processors.

The distinguishing feature of CompCert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code is
formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of the
source C code.

CompCert is an ongoing research project.  The present release is an
advanced prototype intended for research, educational and evaluation
purposes.

For more information on CompCert (supported platforms, supported C
features, installation instructions, using the compiler, etc), please
