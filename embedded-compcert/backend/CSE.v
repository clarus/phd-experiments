(** * Value numbering *)

(** The idea behind value numbering algorithms is to associate
  abstract identifiers (``value numbers'') to the contents of registers
  at various program points, and record equations between these
  identifiers.  For instance, consider the instruction
  [r1 = add(r2, r3)] and assume that [r2] and [r3] are mapped
  to abstract identifiers [x] and [y] respectively at the program
  point just before this instruction.  At the program point just after,
  we can add the equation [z = add(x, y)] and associate [r1] with [z],
  where [z] is a fresh abstract identifier.  However, if we already
  knew an equation [u = add(x, y)], we can preferably add no equation
  and just associate [r1] with [u].  If there exists a register [r4]
  mapped with [u] at this point, we can then replace the instruction
  [r1 = add(r2, r3)] by a move instruction [r1 = r4], therefore eliminating
  a common subexpression and reusing the result of an earlier addition.

  Abstract identifiers / value numbers are represented by positive integers.
  Equations are of the form [valnum = rhs], where the right-hand sides
  [rhs] are either arithmetic operations or memory loads. *)

(** * The static analysis *)

(** We now define a notion of satisfiability of a numbering.  This semantic
  notion plays a central role in the correctness proof (see [CSEproof]),
  but is defined here because we need it to define the ordering over
  numberings used in the static analysis.

  A numbering is satisfiable in a given register environment and memory
  state if there exists a valuation, mapping value numbers to actual values,
  that validates both the equations and the association of registers
  to value numbers. *)

(** We reuse the solver for forward dataflow inequations based on

Module Solver := BBlock_solver(Numbering).

(** The transfer function for the dataflow analysis returns the numbering
  ``after'' execution of the instruction at [pc], as a function of the
  numbering ``before''.  For [Iop] and [Iload] instructions, we add
  equations or reuse existing value numbers as described for
  [add_op] and [add_load].  For [Istore] instructions, we forget
  all equations involving memory loads.  For [Icall] instructions,
  we could simply associate a fresh, unconstrained by equations value number
  to the result register.  However, it is often undesirable to eliminate
  common subexpressions across a function call (there is a risk of
  increasing too much the register pressure across the call), so we
  just forget all equations and start afresh with an empty numbering.
  Finally, for instructions that modify neither registers nor
  the memory, we keep the numbering unchanged.

  For builtin invocations [Ibuiltin], we have three strategies:
- Forget all equations.  This is appropriate for builtins that can be
  turned into function calls ([EF_external], [EF_malloc], [EF_free]).
- Forget equations involving loads but keep equations over registers.
  This is appropriate for builtins that modify memory, e.g. [EF_memcpy].
- Keep all equations, taking advantage of the fact that neither memory
  nor registers are modified.  This is appropriate for annotations,
  for inlined builtin functions, and for volatile loads.
